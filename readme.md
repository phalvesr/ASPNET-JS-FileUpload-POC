### ASP .NET Core and JavaScript pdf files (but you could make a case I can upload pretty much any format) server upload POC ###

Please, be aware that this is only a showcase on how to do files upload to a server using a web client (I went only with pure JS, but it should be simple to do the same in any lib/framework) and a server written in C# (ASP.NET Core 3.1).
